Was thinking about the theme you mentioned - 
'bringing your identity to the party'.

Things that make our approach unique.


QR Code - A secure way to bind the party to a particular place and time. A 'happening'. Keeps everyone out who is not here, right now.

You choose what identity you want to expose. You can carry over identity from an existing provider, or you can create a fresh identity for this party. Important because 
A) not everyone has an external provider (is on facebook)
B) you might not want your facebook identity at this party.
    * facebook profile might be too personal (privacy concerns)
    * facebook profile misses information that is vital for this place and time. Example: at a conference, you might want a list of publications.


Augmented physical social networking. The people are here. What can we do in a nonobtrusive way to facilitate networking.
 * Everyone sees the participants. Can view their party profiles.
 * (pending) Add them to your address-book with a touch 
 * (pending) You can specify your relationship with a persion (colleague, spouse, professor) etc. 
    The system then displays the number of networking 'hops' it takes to get from one of your friends to someone you want to meet.


Digital Persona
 * Collaborate by sharing digital media with others. Motivated by selfish desire to show-off digital persona.
 * The playlist is here and now. The voting determines which song plays, and what people hear at *this* party. Real-time collaboration instead of passive sharing. Collaborative filtering. 
 * Collaborative documenting of the party. Take pictures, give them captions.


Life Journaling
 * Party is a 'happening', A demarcated event. Application captures this.
 * Browse old parties to discover missed connections.
 * The annotated objects (pictures and video) serve as a mneumonic for who was there and what happened.
 * Also serves to discover new media - approved by your friends.
